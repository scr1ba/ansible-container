# Ansible Docker Container
This repository contains a Dockerfile that sets up a lightweight container with Ansible installed. It is based on the python:3.9-alpine image.

The Dockerfile creates a non-root user named ansible, and sets /ansible as the working directory. This is where you should mount your Ansible playbook when you run the container.

# Usage
To run your Ansible playbook in the container, you should mount your ansible directory to /ansible in the container. Here's an example of how to do it using your ssh user and key:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/ansible:/ansible ansible-container /ansible/playbook.yml
```

This one would run the container using your ssh user and key
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/ansible:/ansible ansible-container /ansible/playbook.yml --extra-vars "ansible_ssh_user=scr1ba ansible_ssh_private_key_file=./.ssh/ed25519"
```
